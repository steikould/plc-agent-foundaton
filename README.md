## Project Objective

The primary goal is to establish a production-ready data pipeline for ingesting PI System tags, enriching this raw sensor data with metadata for context, and enabling advanced analytics and ML-driven insights. This involves data casting, reshaping, and structuring within a data lakehouse architecture centered on BigQuery.

## Medallion Architecture

The project leverages a Medallion architecture to progressively refine data through Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

See the overall data flow in `architecture_overview.png`.

### Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

-   **Purpose:** Initial landing zone for raw, immutable PI System data (ID, value, timestamp).
-   **Key Activities:** Scalable and reliable ingestion (e.g., via Litmus, Pub/Sub), security measures (TLS, CMEK, IAM), monitoring, basic schema validation, and de-duplication.
-   **Storage:** Cloud Storage (e.g., `gs://your-pipeline-data-raw/pi_system/`) and BigQuery Bronze tables (e.g., `your_project.pipeline_bronze.raw_pi_data`), partitioned by ingestion date.
-   **Processing:** Light ETL/ELT using Cloud Dataflow (streaming) or Dataproc (batch).

### Silver Layer (Curated/Enriched)

-   **Purpose:** Holds cleaned, transformed, and enriched data. This is the primary source for data scientists and analysts.
-   **Key Activities:**
    -   **Metadata Enrichment:** Joining raw PI tag data with external metadata sources (e.g., sensor-to-asset mapping, equipment specs, pipeline segments) from BigQuery lookup tables or Cloud SQL.
    -   **Data Casting:** Ensuring correct and consistent data types (e.g., STRING to FLOAT64, standardizing units).
    -   **Data Reshaping:** Normalization/denormalization, pivoting/unpivoting, time-series aggregation, joining with operational data.
-   **Storage:** BigQuery Silver tables (e.g., `your_project.pipeline_silver`), optimized with partitioning and clustering.
-   **Processing:** Cloud Dataflow (streaming enrichment), Dataproc (complex batch transformations), Dataform (SQL-based transformations and orchestration), Cloud Composer/Airflow (workflow orchestration).

### Gold Layer (Aggregated/Business-Ready)

-   **Purpose:** Highly aggregated, business-specific datasets optimized for dashboards, reports, or pre-computed ML feature sets.
-   **Key Activities:**
    -   **Domain-Specific Aggregations:** Summary tables for specific business questions (e.g., daily/weekly averages).
    -   **Advanced Feature Engineering for ML:** Creating complex features for ML models (e.g., lagged features, rate of change, statistical spans), potentially stored in Vertex AI Feature Store.
    -   **Geospatial Data Preparation:** Creating GEOGRAPHY data types and performing spatial calculations.
-   **Storage:** BigQuery Gold tables (e.g., `your_project.pipeline_gold`).
-   **Processing:** BigQuery SQL / Dataform, orchestrated by Cloud Composer/Airflow.

## Data Ingestion

The initial step involves transitioning the existing Proof of Concept (POC) with Litmus for PI tag ingestion into a production-grade pipeline. This includes ensuring scalability, reliability, security, and robust monitoring for landing raw data into the Bronze layer.
